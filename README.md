## 📘 Usage

The `scaf` CLI tool provides an easy way to scaffold new projects. Below are some examples of how you can use the `scaf` command.

### 🔧 Commands

- **New**: Create a new project scaffold.

```sh
scaf new <framework> [OPTIONS]
```

### ⚙️ Options

- `--runtime <RUNTIME>`: Specify the JavaScript runtime to use (`bun` or `deno`).
- `--lib <LIBRARIES>`: Additional libraries to include, separated by commas (e.g., `--lib=shadcn,tailwind`).
- `--bundle <BUNDLER>`: Specify the bundler to use (`vite`, `swc`, `pip`, `uv`, `poetry`).
- `--pre-commit <HOOKS>`: Pre-commit hooks to set up, separated by commas (e.g., `--pre-commit=passleak,lint`).
- `--folder <FOLDER>`: Specify the folder where the project should be created.

### 📝 Example Usages

1. Create a React project using Bun:

   ```sh
   scaf new react --runtime=bun --folder=my-react-app
   ```

2. Create a Vue project with specific libraries and bundler:

   ```sh
   scaf new vue --runtime=bun --lib=shadcn,tailwind --bundle=vite --folder=my-vue-app
   ```

3. Create a Flask project with a bundler and pre-commit hooks:

   ```sh
   scaf new flask --bundle=poetry --lib=sqlalchemy,ruff --pre-commit=passleak,lint --folder=my-flask-app
   ```
